   - Mode C: Have existing literature review
   - Mode D: Learning mode
   - Mode E: Upload prior papers
   - Mode F: Upload research proposal
   - Mode G: Custom input

### Step 2: Initialize Project

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/scripts/checklist_manager.py \
  --init \
  --project-dir "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thesis-output/{sanitized-topic-name}" \
  --project-name "{topic}" \
  --research-type {type} \
  --input-mode {mode}
```

### Step 3: Set Orchestrator Environment

```bash
export THESIS_ORCHESTRATOR=1
```

### Step 4: Confirm to User (Korean)

Display:
- Created project directory and structure
- Selected settings (research type, input mode, academic field)
- Total workflow steps (210)
- Next step based on input mode
- Available commands (/thesis:start, /thesis:status, /thesis:learn)
