# Thesis Resume

Recover thesis workflow state after context loss (compact/clear/new session).

## Protocol

### Step 1: Find Active Project

```bash
ls thesis-output/
```

If multiple projects exist, ask user which to resume.

### Step 2: Read Recovery Files

Read these files in order (Context Reset Model from workflow.md):

1. `thesis-output/{project}/session.json` — Current SOT state
2. `thesis-output/{project}/todo-checklist.md` — Step completion status
3. `thesis-output/{project}/research-synthesis.md` — Accumulated insights

### Step 3: Determine Resume Point

Based on SOT current_step, identify:
- Which phase we're in
- What was the last completed step
- What is the next step to execute
- Whether any gate is pending

### Step 4: Restore Checkpoint (if available)

```bash
python3 "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/scripts/checklist_manager.py \
  --status \
  --project-dir "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thesis-output/{project}"
```

### Step 5: Report Recovery (Korean)

Display:
- Recovered project name and state
- Current position in workflow
- Last completed step
- Next action
- Any pending gates or HITL checkpoints

### Step 6: Continue Execution

Proceed with the next step following thesis-orchestrator protocol.
